`rutils` is a home for the various utility functions I have found myself
using commonly enough to package up.

## Installation instructions

There’s no plan to ever submit this package to `CRAN` or `Bioconductor`.
It exists purely for personal use, if you’d like to install the
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) you can use the
following command:

``` r
BiocManager::install("dzhang32/rutils")
```
